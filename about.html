            <p>
                I have been playing Valorant for at least 3 years now, 
                I started my way at the bottom of the barrel having my rank as iron. 
                However with putting time and effort into the game I managed to hit the top percentile.
                In a year I managed to hit immortal, that quickly rose to immortal 2 then 3. 
                At my best I was measured at being top 1000 in the whole of EU. 
                However that was still 2 years ago. Unfortunately I have been busy with my personal life,
                and studies so I do not dedicate that much time anymore. 
                However even with my limited gaming hours I still manage to be immortal every episode, 
                this is due to the skills and know how I've picked up along the way, sure my skill may be diminished
                from what it once was, my knowledge and understanding of the game still stands. 
                Due to this I can help you reach the rank you desire, 
                with personal 1 on 1 tutoring alongside specifically making plans suited to you.
