## What is Valorant? 

Valorant is a free-to-play first-person shooter. Specializing in a tactical playstyle, 
the game itself is fairly in-depth and can seem daunting to understand. But that's where I come in. 
I can help you understand the game from the basics or from a pro's perspective. 
If you still want to know more about Valorant itself, check out the video below from the official Valorant YouTube channel, 
showcasing some gameplay.

## About Me 

I have been playing Valorant for at least 3 years now. I started my journey at the bottom of the barrel, 
with my rank as iron. However, with dedication and effort, I managed to climb to the top percentile. 
Within a year, I reached Immortal rank, and quickly rose to Immortal 2 and 3. At my best, I was ranked in the top 1000 in the whole of EU. 
Though my gaming hours have been reduced due to personal life and studies, I still maintain Immortal rank every episode. 
My skills may have diminished from what they once were, but my knowledge and understanding of the game remain intact.
